	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h3>Originally from Tennessee and Maryland. I attended New York Univrsity in NYC and double majored in computer science and finance. At NYU, I developed my interests for software, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and game development. In addition, I was a freshmen resident assistant and actively involved in campus student organizations. While in NYC, I also developed my interests in modeling and have had several experiences with various photo shoots. Check out my modeling page for photo samples!</h3>
	<h3>Currently, I am a software engineer at Amazon focusing on the voice shopping experience while modeling, cooking, gyming, and traveling with friends in my free time. I am always interested in opportunities to further my interests, so feel free to contact me if you're interested in working with me!</h3>

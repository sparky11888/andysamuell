	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h3>I grew up in Tennessee and then, went to high school in Maryland. Later, I went on to attend New York Univrsity in NYC where I double majored in computer science and finance. At NYU, I developed my interests for software, particularly in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and game development. In addition, I was a freshmen resident assistant and actively involved in campus student organizations. While in NYC, I also developed my interests in modeling and have had several experiences with various photo shoots.</h3>
	<h3>Currently, I am a software engineer at Amazon focusing on the voice shopping experience while modeling, cooking, and gyming in my free time. I am always interested in opportunities to further my interests in software, modeling, and other areas that may be of interest, so feel free to contact me if you think there's a good match!</h3>
